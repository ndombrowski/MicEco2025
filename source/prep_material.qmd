## List of nanopore adaptors

For this tutorial I want to test fastplong as alternative to porechop followed by chopper. While fastplong should allow for automatic detection of adapters I also want to try and test it by providing a list of all possible adapter sequences.

```{bash}
cd /zfs/omics/projects/bioinformatics/scripts

# Get the porechop adapter script to get an input file for fastplong 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrwick/Porechop/refs/heads/master/porechop/adapters.py

# Write script to extract all barcodes but output a fasta file of the full adapters
mkdir ../files/nanopore 
python parse_adapters.py
```

This script produces two files 

- full_adapters.fasta (full adapters including all native and rapid barcodes)
- barcode_only_adapters.fasta (just barcode sequences)
